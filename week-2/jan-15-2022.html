2. Determine Winner or Draw:
   Write a function that checks if there's a winning pattern:
   - Determine all patterns in Tic Tac Toe x
   - Create object where the pattern is expressed
   - Write function to go through pattern
   - Count number of moves
   - If count is 9 and no winner is found, declare draw

3. Handle making moves:
   Write move function:
   - Pass character to function
   - Add character to cell
   - Run Determine Winner function to see if there's a winner
   - Only run Determine Winner function on the 5th turn onward

4. Handle changing players:
   Write function that switches players:
